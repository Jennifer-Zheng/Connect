# Connect
We live in a time where nearly everyone is available at the touch of a screen. While this is incredibly convenient, it can result in less frequent face-to-face interactions and less meaningful connections with the people we know. This can also inhibit us from organically growing our social network by meeting the friends of our friends. 

What our app aims to do is connect people by showing them local users who share mutual connections. Mutual connections will be shown on user cards and their profiles.

TLDR: We want you to be able to use the people you already know to vet your next connections.

## Functionality
Relationships are specified using pre-set relationship types such as friends, siblings, roommates, and much more.

Connections are ranked using proximity as well as the degree of familiarity (number of mutuals). 

Users will be able to:
* view other usersâ€™ profiles and see their connections and the type of relationship they share with that connection 
* add these users and directly message them

We hope that the mutual connections will serve as great conversation starters and establish a sense of familiarity.
